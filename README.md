# Overview

This is a console-based guess the number game. The game will generate a random number between a given set of numbers and then give the user a certain number of guesses to guess the number. When the user enters a guess, the program will tell the user if their guess was too low or too high to help prompt them to the correct number. The program will also keep track of the lowest number of guesses for each level of the game and save the lowest scores in a .txt file.

I wrote this program in order to learn the Java language. Making this program has helped me to become familiar with the language and what it is capable of.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used Visual Studio Code, Java, Git, and GitHub.

I used Java as my programming language for this program.

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to do the following to this progarm:

- Have the program tell the user when they have achieved a new high score
- Make it so that you can't go onto the next level without first guessing the correct number on the level you are on
- Make it so that you can choose which unlocked level you would like to play on instead of having to go in order
